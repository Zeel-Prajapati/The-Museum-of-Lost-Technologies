    </section>
        <p class="con">Before smartphones and instant messaging, the Pager (also called a beeper) was the ultimate symbol of connection. From doctors to business
            professionals, this tiny device carried messages faster than letters and cooler than a phone call.</p>

        <h3 class="hh">How It Worked</h3>
    </section>
        <p class="con">A pager used radio signals to receive messages sent from a central paging network.</p>
        <p class="con">When a message arrived, it displayed a beep, vibration, or flashing light, alerting the user to check the screen.</p>
        <p class="con">Some pagers showed numbers only, while advanced versions could display short text messages like ‚ÄúCall home‚Äù or ‚ÄúMeet at 6.‚Äù</p>

    <section class="fhdg">
        <h3  class="hh">Legacy and Impact</h3>
    </section>
        <p class="con">The pager introduced the idea of wireless personal communication a stepping stone to today‚Äôs mobile phones.</p>
        <p class="con">It taught the world to stay reachable anytime, anywhere, and paved the way for the SMS revolution that followed.</p>
        <p class="con">Even today, pagers are still used in hospitals and emergency services because of their reliable signal coverage when mobile networks fail.</p>

    <section class="fhdg">
