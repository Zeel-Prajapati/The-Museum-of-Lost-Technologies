        <h3 class="hh">Introduction</h3>
    </section>
        <p class="con">Before USB drives and cloud storage, the Floppy Disk was the heartbeat of personal computing. From saving assignments to
                transferring games between friends, this small magnetic square carried the weight of digital history.</p>
                
    <section class="fhdg">
        <h3 class="hh">Origin Story</h3>
    </section>
        <p class="con">Invented by IBM in 1967, the floppy disk revolutionized how people stored and shared data. Early versions were 8 inches wide, followed
            by the popular 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch models that dominated the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

    <section class="fhdg">
        <h3 class="hh">How It Worked</h3>
    </section>
        <p class="con">A floppy disk was made of a thin magnetic disk enclosed in a plastic shell.</p>
        <p class="con">When inserted into a floppy drive, it spun while the read/write head magnetically recorded or retrieved information.</p>
        <p class="con">Most disks stored between 720 KB and 1.44 MB tiny by today’s standards, but once, that was enough to hold an entire operating system!</p>

    <section class="fhdg">
        <h3  class="hh">Legacy and Impact</h3>
    </section>
        <p class="con">The floppy disk symbolized the birth of portable data storage. It inspired the creation of CDs, USBs, and even cloud systems.</p>
        <p class="con">Even today, the 💾 icon remains a universal symbol for “Save” a digital fossil preserved in modern software.</p>

    <section class="fhdg">
        <h3 class="hh">Did You Know? 💡</h3>
    </section>
        <p class="con">NASA’s Space Shuttle computers used floppy disks until 2011.</p>
        <p class="con">Some early PC games came on 10 or more disks players had to keep swapping them to continue playing.</p>
        <p class="con">The name “floppy” came from the flexible nature of the first disk versions.</p>

    <section class="fhdg">
        <h3 class="hh">Conclusion</h3>
    </section>
        <p class="con">The floppy disk reminds us of a simpler, hands-on era of computing when saving data felt tangible. Though obsolete, its spirit 
            still lives on every time you hit 💾 Save.</p>
