        <h3 class="hh">Introduction</h3>
    </section>
        <p class="con">Before flat screens and LED displays, the world saw technology through the glow of a CRT Monitor.</p>
        <p class="con">These bulky giants brought computers, games, and graphics to life one pixel at a time shaping the digital dreams of an entire
            generation.</p>
                
    <section class="fhdg">
        <h3 class="hh">Origin Story</h3>
    </section>
        <p class="con">The Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) technology was first demonstrated in the late 1800s, but it wasn‚Äôt until the 1970s and 1980s that CRT monitors
            became a familiar sight on office desks and in computer labs worldwide.</p>
        <p class="con">They were heavy, curved, and sometimes flickery but they were our first true windows to the digital world.</p>

    <section class="fhdg">
        <h3 class="hh">How It Worked</h3>
    </section>
        <p class="con">A CRT monitor used an electron gun to shoot beams onto a phosphorescent screen, lighting it up to form images.</p>
        <p class="con">The inside of the screen was coated with red, green, and blue phosphors combining to create millions of colors.</p>
        <p class="con">While modern displays use flat panels, CRTs had that deep, warm glow that felt almost alive.</p>

    <section class="fhdg">
        <h3  class="hh">Legacy and Impact</h3>
    </section>
        <p class="con">CRTs were the heartbeat of early computing, powering everything from DOS terminals to retro games like Pac-Man and Super Mario.</p>
        <p class="con">They introduced millions to the idea of visual computing, long before HD, 4K, or OLED existed.</p>
        <p class="con">Even today, retro gamers treasure CRTs for their authentic color depth and smooth display that modern monitors can‚Äôt quite replicate.</p>

    <section class="fhdg">
        <h3 class="hh">Did You Know? üí°</h3>
    </section>
        <p class="con">The ‚Äúscreen burn-in‚Äù effect came from CRTs when static images stayed too long, they left permanent marks.</p>
        <p class="con">CRTs could weigh up to 30 kilograms and generate a small amount of static electricity.</p>
        <p class="con">Some artists today use old CRTs in digital art projects for their vintage aesthetic and glow.</p>

    <section class="fhdg">
        <h3 class="hh">Conclusion</h3>
    </section>
        <p class="con">The CRT monitor wasn‚Äôt just a screen it was a portal to the future.</p>
        <p class="con">It lit up the imaginations of millions, marking the dawn of the computer age.</p>
